                At the University of Washington, I pursued the Leadership Minor to intentionally grow as a leader through both academic study and hands-on experience. It helped me reflect on my values, sharpen my skills, and lead with purpose across different areas of my life.

                        <strong>Eagerness:</strong> A hunger to learn, grow, and serve. Eagerness means stepping up before being asked, taking initiative even when it's uncomfortable, and staying curious.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <strong>Responsibility:</strong> Doing what needs to be done‚Äîwhether or not anyone‚Äôs watching. It means owning outcomes, holding myself accountable, and following through with integrity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <strong>Growth:</strong> Not about perfection, but progress. I value feedback, iteration, and being open to discomfort if it means learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <strong>Team Player:</strong> I believe in shared wins, lifting others up, and building bridges between people, especially in cross-functional teams.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <strong>Do Good:</strong> Lead with kindness, fairness, and intention. I aim to leave things better than I found them.

                        <strong>Paver of the Way:</strong> If no one will do it, I will. I create new paths and open space for others to follow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <strong>Good Example:</strong> I lead by doing. I strive to be someone others can look up to through consistency and humility.

                        <p>
                        <strong>Efficient Communicator:</strong> I value clarity and conciseness, especially across teams with different backgrounds.

                    <p>
                        I do what I do because I want to be the example I never had. I want others‚Äîespecially younger students, peers, and those entering tech‚Äîto feel supported, seen, and capable. I believe leadership means service, and I use my knowledge, my drive, and my values to uplift others. I aim to be a servant leader who listens first, acts second, and always looks back to see who else I can bring forward.

                    <p>
                        In the future, I see myself leading as a <strong>Technical Program Manager</strong>, working across large, dynamic teams. My priority will always be to foster <strong>healthy team culture</strong>, where people feel safe to share, fail, grow, and collaborate. Leadership to me isn't about chasing success‚Äîit's about investing in people. Whether I'm driving timelines or managing projects, I want my leadership to be felt through the way I create space for others to thrive.

                            <h2>üéØ Definition of Leadership</h2>
                            <p>
                            Leadership is leading with <strong>purpose and good intent</strong>. It‚Äôs being the person that everyone wants to have in their group project or on their team ‚Äî someone who carries their weight but also drives and encourages others to be better. They help set the tone for the whole group and don‚Äôt necessarily strive for personal success, but rather the well-being and growth of the team.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            A key principle of good leadership is to be <strong>genuine</strong>. Showing that you truly care about the people you‚Äôre leading. Authenticity builds trust and motivates others more than authority or status ever could.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another important principle is to be a <strong>self-starter</strong>. Taking initiative and not waiting on others to act. Leaders who proactively step up set a positive example and keep momentum moving forward.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mb-5">
                            <h2>‚è≥ Evolution Over Time</h2>
                            <p>
                            In high school, the leaders were those who were in ASB, they were popular, everyone knew them, and everyone had their eyes on them. They made real change and made decisions for the school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Transitioning into college, leaders were the ones who were the most social, had a lot of friends, and always knew what was happening and what to do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Now, I see that being a leader doesn‚Äôt mean being the loudest. I‚Äôve had many team projects and group projects where the person who I aspire to be is the one working the hardest ‚Äî doing the challenging work that no one else wants to do. That, to me, is leadership.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In industry, the best leaders (or bosses) are the ones who really care about their team. I want to be a manager who is kind, forgiving, and understanding ‚Äî one that values team growth.
